# Logic Gate Simulator

## Project Description

Welcome to the Logic Gate Simulator! This fun and interactive web app helps you understand the basics of digital logic gates. By playing around with different inputs and gates, you can see how they work and learn more about digital electronics and Boolean algebra.

## Features

- **Easy to Use:** The simulator has a simple and clean interface, making it easy for anyone to use and learn from.
- **Variety of Logic Gates:** Try out different logic gates like AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR to see how they operate.
- **Real-Time Results:** The output updates automatically based on your choices, giving you instant feedback.
- **Responsive Design:** Works great on any device, whether you're on a computer, tablet, or phone.
- **Highlighted Results:** The output is highlighted to make it easy to see the results of your selections.

## How It Works

1. **Pick Your Inputs:** Choose either 0 or 1 for Input 1 and Input 2 from the dropdown menus.
2. **Select a Logic Gate:** Pick one of the logic gates (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) to see how it processes the inputs.
3. **See the Result:** The simulator instantly shows the result of the logic operation based on your inputs and selected gate.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Sets up the structure of the app.
- **CSS:** Makes the app look nice and user-friendly.
- **JavaScript:** Handles the logic and updates the result based on your input.
